Math Team was basically a team where we competed against other schools in the Oahu Math League. There were two sides: JV and Varsity. JV consists of 9th and 10th graders while Varsity consisted of 11th and 12th graders for the most part. In this league, we have a total of seven meets throughout the school year in order to see which school has the best Math Team. Over the course of the four years that I competed in (2013-2017), our school's team placed 3rd in JV in 2013-2014, 2nd in JV in 2014-2015, 3rd in Varsity in 2015-2016, and 3rd in Varsity in 2016-2017.

For this project, I was mainly just a team member for my first three years. I worked my way up the ladder and eventually in my senior year, I became one of the captains of the Math Team. As a captain, my role was to teach workshops to the underclassmen, make the schedule for Math Team, and basically just assist any and all members who needed help. I tried my best to provide an enjoyable learning environment while I was teaching and one of my main focuses was to make sure my members were comfortable with me so that they felt that they could approach me. The reason I did this was because when I was working my way up, I remember being shy about asking questions even though I needed help but the previous captains were all friendly and approachable so that made it easier.

Overall, this experience was probably one of the best I have had in my life. I learned things like how to be a real team player and how to be able to teach others how to solve problems. It gave me a great sense of joy when I was able to teach others what was taught to me from other previous members. I also enjoyed the fun of competition and being able to pit myself up against other bright minds. It was definitely an enjoyable experience and one that I will never forget.
