During my years in high school, I spent three of them volunteering as a part of a club called LEO Club. It stands for Leadership, Experience, and Opportunity Club. In this club, we volunteered for a number of different events such as monthly beach clean ups, various festivals, and marathons as well. 

As a sophomore in my first year in the club, I was merely a member trying to find my way in the club. As a junior, I was familiar with the club and tried to participate actively as a member, but I knew I wanted something more so I then ran for president in my senior year. I won and became the president of LEO Club. As the president, my duties were basically to schedule all the events like the monthly beach cleanups and marathons as well as to distribute tasks evenly among my other officers. I met up with countless people in order to get volunteer opportunities for our club and in the end, I think we did a good job that year.

From this experience, I gained a lot in terms of leadership; it was probably one of the biggest roles I had played so far in my life, being the president of a club. I also learned a lot about teamwork and how to work with others in order to make our club run smoothly. It was something that was very valuable for me and it helped shape me to be the person I am today.
