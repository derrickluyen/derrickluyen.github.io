## Why learn Semantic UI?

Semantic UI is a UI framework that is quite difficult to use. So far, I have been using it for about a week now and I can say from personal experience that this is not exactly my cup of tea. The question now is why? What is the true purpose of using UI Framweworks rather than learning raw HTML and CSS? Earlier when I said it was not exactly my cup of tea. it was the complete truth. However, raw HTML and CSS is even less than that for me as a programmer. I believe that Semantic UI makes it easier for programmers to design a nice looking user interface. The reason why is that there are a lot of specific functionalities in Semantic UI (and frameworks in general) that help us out as users. There are things like collections that help us grounp things together, as well as views and modules to make those things easier as well. Overall, Semantic UI may be a bit difficult to learn, but it makes the process of making a UI simpler over just raw HTML and CSS.

## Personal Reflection

Like I mentioned earlier, I have worked with Semantic UI for about a week now at the time of writing this paper. I can definitely say that it was difficult but interesting at the same time. Personally, I like challenging things as it propels me to learn about new things and gain new knowledge that I did not have before. Semantic UI is a perfect example of that. UI Frameworks in general would be a good example for that. It is definitely challenging to learn but once you do learn it, it makes your life a lot easier as a programmer because there are many useful tools in UI Frameworks that you can apply when making a good UI.
