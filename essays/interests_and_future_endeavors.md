## Interests In Software Engineering

My interests in software engineering are game development and artificial intelligence. Ever since I was a kid, I always had an interest in games, particularly sports games. I always thought that I would be interested in being able to make those kinds of games. That is what led to me to Computer Science and software engineering. I want to be someone who makes games that others can play and have fun in doing so. That is one of the main reasons I became a Computer Science major. I am also interested in artificial intelligence. I find it interesting how robots can be programmed to act somewhat similar to humans and are able to respond on their own. I did a research paper about artificial intelligence in one of my previous classes and found it to be extremely interesting so that is something that catches my eye as well.

## Future Endeavors

In the future, in terms of skills, I hope that I can gain the skills to be able to properly make a good game. I want to be able to develop my own graphical user interface and be able to make my own game that everyone can have fun playing. I want to be able to make my own AI as well so I can incorporate that into the game as well. Personally, I am a fan of playing games against the CPU or the AI because it provides a challenge and for the most part, the AI is better than normal people. It makes the games more challenging and also I like playing things like story modes which involve AI as well.

Experiences that I would want to develop in the future are I want to be able to develop my own game or at least have a part in developing a game. This would be very interesting to say the least because with this experience, I would be able to see how the process of creating a game goes down and I can visualize all the little bits and pieces along the way. Something else I would like to do is to be able to possibly develop my own artificial intelligence to incorporate into a bigger idea like a game. I already had some exposure to this when I was programming my tic-tac-toe game for my senior project in high school. For that project, I made a basic AI that was able to counter moves made by the user so I have a tiny bit of experience in that department. However, I hope to learn a lot more about AIs, how they work, and also how to make my own game in the future.
