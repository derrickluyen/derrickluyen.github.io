## Why are smart questions important to software engineers?

Smart questions are important in all aspects of life when you do not know something and you want to learn more about it. In terms of software engineering, it is important because you want to make sure you get exactly what you need to know. You can achieve this by asking a smart question. A smart question is one that gives a little info on what you are looking for and asks for a push in the right direction rather than directly asking someone to basically do the work for you. Smart questions essentially provide a guide to exactly what you need help on; otherwise, the reader may not be able to decipher what you are asking for and possibly give you an answer that does not even pertain to what you were looking for.

## Examples of Smart & Not Smart Questions and Responses

Here is an example of a smart question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29134512/insecureplatformwarning-a-true-sslcontext-object-is-not-available-this-prevent. Why is this a smart question? It is a smart question because it is clearly showing what the error is. The user is not blaming the error on anyone or anything else but rather he is looking for a specific answer to the question. Also, one important thing to note is that he is not specifically asking for an answer. The user is asking for any tips that could possibly help them find the answer rather than blatantly just asking for someone to do the work for them. These are all aspects of asking a smart question.
The responses given to this smart question also prove that it is indeed a smart question. All the responses directly address what the user was asking for without giving away too much information. The responders give responses that tell the user what exactly is wrong and what he needs to do to fix it in a clear and concise manner. It gives the user the tips that he or she was looking for in order to solve that problem. These responses show the foundation of what smart responses should look like.

Here is an example of a question that is not smart: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7050503/javascript-why-doesnt-this-work. This is not a smart question because the question that the user is literally asking is "why doesn't this work?" They do not give any insight on what or where the problem seems to be. They just inserted a block of code and asked why it does not work. With the way the user asked the question, it screams for someone to tell them to STFW (search the f... web). The user needs to be clearer when presenting the question and show what exactly does not work. They need to provide a more detailed explanation on where the code is going wrong, or for this example, they need to provide any explanation at all.
The responses given to this question also show that it is not a smart question. The responses were either "you forgot something" or "here is a new version of your code." Both of these answers show that the question is not smart. For the first response, it does point out the error but it shows that the question was not smart because the error was simply a syntactic error in that case. Also, in regards to the second response, it puts on the table that the original code was unfixable so the responder felt the need to write a new piece of code in order to address the problem at hand which was already vague to begin with. This shows how the question was not a smart question.
