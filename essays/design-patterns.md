## Design Patterns in life
Imagine you are having one of those days where you are just sick. You are laying in bed and do not have any energy to do anything. What is the one thing that comes to mind after that? For me, it is the idea of getting better. What do people normally do to get better? They take some sort of medicine, whether it be your mother's home remedy, prescription medicine, or any other kind. Medicine is normally the solution for getting sick and that is exactly what a design pattern is. A design pattern is a solution that is repeated for a common problem. Based on what I was saying, medicine is the general solution for the common problem of getting sick. Medicine is a solution that can be repeated over and over again but yet it still works in solving the problem of someone being sick.
