## My Impression of Javascript

Javascript is a language that I am sure has many appealing points. Although I am still a newbie at it, I can tell that I will enjoy learning about it. So far, it has been a great experience just learning the basics of Javascript and how it differs from other programming languages like Java, C, etc. One huge difference that I noticed is the fact that when variables are declared, you can just use let or const rather than the standard char or int variables used in other languages. This point really intrigues me because in my eyes, it makes Javascript more flexible than other languages by not having to explicitly say what kind of variable you need; you just need to declare a variable.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
