## My Impression of Javascript

Javascript is a language that I am sure has many appealing points. Although I am still a newbie at it, I can tell that I will enjoy learning about it. So far, it has been a great experience just learning the basics of Javascript and how it differs from other programming languages like Java, C, etc. One huge difference that I noticed is the fact that when variables are declared, you can just use let or const rather than the standard char or int variables used in other languages. This point really intrigues me because in my eyes, it makes Javascript more flexible than other languages by not having to explicitly say what kind of variable you need; you just need to declare a variable.

## Is Javascript fit for Software Engineering?

I, for one, cannot call myself an expert in Javascript. Like I mentioned earlier, I am definitely a rookie when it comes to this language. However, I do have an opinion about Javascript just based on the small amount of knowledge that I do have on it. To me, Javascript is definitely a language that would be fit for software engineering. It is mostly beneficial when using HTML and making websites since it is a script language; well at least that is what I know so far. This fact is very helpful when it comes to softward engineering because one of the main points of software engineering is using HTML and making websites which are an integral part of our society today. However, one downfall to this is that since Javascript is a script language, it uses an interpreter unlike native languages which results in a slower program. While this is a problem, it is not a major problem as software engineering is all about dedicating time to hone the practice so time is not a big issue.

## Athletic Software Engineering: Superior or Inferior?

My first impression of athletic software engineering was me thinking to myself that it was going to be a long semester. I knew coming into this class that it was one of the hardest classes that the ICS department here at UH Manoa had to offer. I also knew that the class itself was based on a flipped system where we learn everything outside of class and we come to class prepared for our WODs (Workout Of the Day). Even with all the rigor, I do think that it is definitely showing good results. The practice WODs that are given out beforehand in order to help students prepare for the actual WODs are very helpful as they help us get going on the right track. Although the practice WODs are not exactly what the real WODs are like, they are similar enough and provide an environment that imitates that of a real WOD; in that sense, the practice WODs are very helpful. Overall, this athletic style of learning is very different from most styles that I have experienced prior to this class. However, so far, it is one of the more favorable learning styles that I have come across because it actually challenges me to do my very best in everything and the fact that it is used in something that I have high interest in (Computer Science) makes it all the more gratifying when I succeed at it. It is definitely rigorous like I mentioned earlier, but nothing in life comes easy. You have to work for everything which is exactly what this system is showing.
