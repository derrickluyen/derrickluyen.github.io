## My Impression of Javascript

Javascript is a language that I am sure has many appealing points. Although I am still a newbie at it, I can tell that I will enjoy learning about it. So far, it has been a great experience just learning the basics of Javascript and how it differs from other programming languages like Java, C, etc. One huge difference that I noticed is the fact that when variables are declared, you can just use let or const rather than the standard char or int variables used in other languages. This point really intrigues me because in my eyes, it makes Javascript more flexible than other languages by not having to explicitly say what kind of variable you need; you just need to declare a variable.

## Is Javascript fit for Software Engineering?

I, for one, cannot call myself an expert in Javascript. Like I mentioned earlier, I am definitely a rookie when it comes to this language. However, I do have an opinion about Javascript just based on the small amount of knowledge that I do have on it. To me, Javascript is definitely a language that would be fit for software engineering. It is mostly beneficial when using HTML and making websites since it is a script language; well at least that is what I know so far. This fact is very helpful when it comes to softward engineering because one of the main points of software engineering is using HTML and making websites which are an integral part of our society today. However, one downfall to this is that since Javascript is a script language, it uses an interpreter unlike native languages which results in a slower program. While this is a problem, it is not a major problem as software engineering is all about dedicating time to hone the practice so time is not a big issue.

## Athletic Software Engineering: Superior or Inferior?

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
